                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Put yourself in your patient's shoes. What would they search for in the middle of the night?

                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Operating in different parts of Bowie? Craft unique pages for each locale. Let every neighborhood feel special!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Maintain consistency in your contact information. A Google Map on your page is like a virtual "You Are Here" sign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Write about health issues relevant to Bowie. Engage with community initiatives. Highlight your local physiotherapy heroes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Encourage happy patients to spread the love online. And always respond - good or bad. (Yes, even to that one patient who complains about everything.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Secure spots in local business listings and physiotherapy registries. Partner with Bowie enterprises. Aim to be the most recognized Physical Therapist in town!
                    </li>

                      <strong>Tighten Your Loose Bolts:</strong> Optimize your site for mobile devices, quick loading times, and search engine crawlability. Remember, a sluggish site is the fastest way to lose visitors and search rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Start a blog focusing on Bowie health topics. Be the go-to source for physiotherapy info in your area.
