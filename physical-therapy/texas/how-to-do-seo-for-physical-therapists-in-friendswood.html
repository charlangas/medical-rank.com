                <h2>8 Tactics to Optimize Your Website for patient Attraction</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Put yourself in your patient's shoes. What would they search for in the middle of the night?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Best Physical Therapist near me in Friendswood"</li>
                        <li>"Urgent physiotherapy help Friendswood"</li>
                        <li>"Best Physical Therapist in Friendswood"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Covering various locations? Dedicate a page to each area. Spread the physiotherapy love across Friendswood!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Ensure your business details are uniform across all platforms. Adding a Google Map is like leaving breadcrumbs for patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Love:</strong> Create content focused on Friendswood's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Friendswood-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Everything:</strong> Inspire your pleased patient to leave reviews. Address all comments, the good and the bad. (Yes, including that one perpetually unsatisfied individual.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Credibility:</strong> Ensure your practice appears in Friendswood directories and physiotherapy listings. Collaborate with nearby establishments. Become Friendswood's go-to Physical Therapist!
                    </li>

                      <strong>Tighten Your Loose Bolts:</strong> Ensure your website is responsive, fast-loading, and search engine-friendly. Slow, complicated sites are a turn-off for both patient and Google.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Friendswood's physiotherapy scene. Establish yourself as the local physiotherapy authority.
