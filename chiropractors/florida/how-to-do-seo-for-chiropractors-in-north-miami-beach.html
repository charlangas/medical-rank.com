                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your North Miami Beach neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
