                <h2>8 Tactics to Optimize Your Website for patient Attraction</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Think like your patients. What are they typing into Google at 2 AM?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Best Therapist near me in Vancouver"</li>
                        <li>"Urgent mental health help Vancouver"</li>
                        <li>"Highly recommended Therapist Vancouver"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Vancouver neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Maintain consistency in your contact information. A Google Map on your page is like a virtual "You Are Here" sign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Create content focused on Vancouver's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Vancouver-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Motivate satisfied patient to share their experiences. Respond to all feedback, positive or negative. (Even the chronic complainers deserve attention.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Credibility:</strong> Secure spots in local business listings and mental health registries. Partner with Vancouver enterprises. Aim to be the most recognized Therapist in town!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Tech It Up:</strong> Optimize your site for mobile devices, quick loading times, and search engine crawlability. Remember, a sluggish site is the fastest way to lose visitors and search rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Create a blog addressing Vancouver-specific mental health concerns. Become the trusted voice for local mental health matters.
