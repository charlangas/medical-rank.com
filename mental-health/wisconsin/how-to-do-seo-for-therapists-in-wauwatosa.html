                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Think like your patients. What are they typing into Google at 2 AM?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Therapist in Wauwatosa"</li>
                        <li>"Urgent mental health help Wauwatosa"</li>
                        <li>"Wauwatosa's favorite Therapist"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Wauwatosa neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Ensure your business details are uniform across all platforms. Adding a Google Map is like leaving breadcrumbs for patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Love:</strong> Blog about Wauwatosa health topics. Get involved in community events. Spotlight your awesome local staff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Inspire your pleased patient to leave reviews. Address all comments, the good and the bad. (Yes, including that one perpetually unsatisfied individual.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
