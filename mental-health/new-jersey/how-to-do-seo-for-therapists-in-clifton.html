                <h2>8 Ways to Make Your Website a Patient-Attracting Machine</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Put yourself in your patient's shoes. What would they search for in the middle of the night?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Top-rated Therapist Clifton"</li>
                        <li>"Emergency mental health care near me"</li>
                        <li>"Clifton's favorite Therapist"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Clifton neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Ensure your business details are uniform across all platforms. Adding a Google Map is like leaving breadcrumbs for patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Create content focused on Clifton's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Clifton-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Everything:</strong> Inspire your pleased patient to leave reviews. Address all comments, the good and the bad. (Yes, including that one perpetually unsatisfied individual.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Credibility:</strong> Get listed in local directories and mental health associations. Team up with local businesses. Be the Therapist everyone in Clifton knows!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Tech It Up:</strong> Ensure your website is responsive, fast-loading, and search engine-friendly. Slow, complicated sites are a turn-off for both patient and Google.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Clifton's mental health scene. Establish yourself as the local mental health authority.
                    </li>
