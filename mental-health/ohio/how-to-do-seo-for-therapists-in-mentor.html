                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Imagine your patient's late-night health concerns. What would they Google?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Top-rated Therapist Mentor"</li>
                        <li>"Emergency mental health care near me"</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Write about health issues relevant to Mentor. Engage with community initiatives. Highlight your local mental health heroes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Everything:</strong> Inspire your pleased patient to leave reviews. Address all comments, the good and the bad. (Yes, including that one perpetually unsatisfied individual.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Get listed in local directories and mental health associations. Team up with local businesses. Be the Therapist everyone in Mentor knows!

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Mentor's mental health scene. Establish yourself as the local mental health authority.
