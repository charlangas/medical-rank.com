                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Think like your patients. What are they typing into Google at 2 AM?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Therapist in North Port"</li>
                        <li>"24/7 mental health services North Port"</li>
                        <li>"Highly recommended Therapist North Port"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your North Port neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>

                      <strong>Show Some Local Love:</strong> Write about health issues relevant to North Port. Engage with community initiatives. Highlight your local mental health heroes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Encourage happy patients to spread the love online. And always respond - good or bad. (Yes, even to that one patient who complains about everything.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Ensure your practice appears in North Port directories and mental health listings. Collaborate with nearby establishments. Become North Port's go-to Therapist!
