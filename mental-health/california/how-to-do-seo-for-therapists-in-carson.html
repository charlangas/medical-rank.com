                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Imagine your patient's late-night health concerns. What would they Google?

                        <li>"Urgent mental health help Carson"</li>
                        <li>"Carson's favorite Therapist"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Everything:</strong> Motivate satisfied patient to share their experiences. Respond to all feedback, positive or negative. (Even the chronic complainers deserve attention.)
                    </li>
