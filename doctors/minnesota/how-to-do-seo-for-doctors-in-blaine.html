                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Operating in different parts of Blaine? Craft unique pages for each locale. Let every neighborhood feel special!
                    </li>

                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Maintain consistency in your contact information. A Google Map on your page is like a virtual "You Are Here" sign.
                    </li>
