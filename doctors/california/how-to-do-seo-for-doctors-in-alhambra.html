                <h2>8 Ways to Make Your Website a Patient-Attracting Machine</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Put yourself in your patient's shoes. What would they search for in the middle of the night?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Top-rated Doctor Alhambra"</li>
                        <li>"Emergency medical care near me"</li>
                        <li>"Highly recommended Doctor Alhambra"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Operating in different parts of Alhambra? Craft unique pages for each locale. Let every neighborhood feel special!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Create content focused on Alhambra's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Alhambra-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Encourage happy patients to spread the love online. And always respond - good or bad. (Yes, even to that one patient who complains about everything.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Get listed in local directories and medical associations. Team up with local businesses. Be the Doctor everyone in Alhambra knows!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Tech It Up:</strong> Ensure your website is responsive, fast-loading, and search engine-friendly. Slow, complicated sites are a turn-off for both patient and Google.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Write Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Alhambra's medical scene. Establish yourself as the local medical authority.
                    </li>
