                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Think like your patients. What are they typing into Google at 2 AM?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Best Doctor near me in Huber Heights"</li>
                        <li>"Urgent medical help Huber Heights"</li>
                        <li>"Huber Heights's favorite Doctor"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Create Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Huber Heights neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Maintain consistency in your contact information. A Google Map on your page is like a virtual "You Are Here" sign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Love:</strong> Create content focused on Huber Heights's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Huber Heights-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Inspire your pleased patient to leave reviews. Address all comments, the good and the bad. (Yes, including that one perpetually unsatisfied individual.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Get listed in local directories and medical associations. Team up with local businesses. Be the Doctor everyone in Huber Heights knows!

                      <strong>Tech It Up:</strong> Ensure your website is responsive, fast-loading, and search engine-friendly. Slow, complicated sites are a turn-off for both patient and Google.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Blog Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Huber Heights's medical scene. Establish yourself as the local medical authority.
