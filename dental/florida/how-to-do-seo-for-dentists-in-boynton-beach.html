                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Think like your patients. What are they typing into Google at 2 AM?
                      <ul>
                        <li>"Best Dentist near me in Boynton Beach"</li>
                        <li>"24/7 dental services Boynton Beach"</li>
                        <li>"Highly recommended Dentist Boynton Beach"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Boynton Beach neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pimp Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent. Throw in a Google Map for good measure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Show Some Local Flavor:</strong> Create content focused on Boynton Beach's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Boynton Beach-based team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reviews Are Gold:</strong> Encourage happy patients to spread the love online. And always respond - good or bad. (Yes, even to that one patient who complains about everything.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Local Street Cred:</strong> Secure spots in local business listings and dental registries. Partner with Boynton Beach enterprises. Aim to be the most recognized Dentist in town!

                      <strong>Tighten Your Loose Bolts:</strong> Ensure your website is responsive, fast-loading, and search engine-friendly. Slow, complicated sites are a turn-off for both patient and Google.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Blog Like a Local:</strong> Launch a blog centered around Boynton Beach's dental scene. Establish yourself as the local dental authority.
