                <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Target Local Keywords:</strong> Imagine your patient's late-night health concerns. What would they Google?
                      <ul>

                        <li>"24/7 dental services Redding"</li>
                        <li>"Redding's favorite Dentist"</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Build Location-Specific Pages:</strong> Serve multiple areas? Create pages for each one. Show some love to all your Redding neighborhoods!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve Your 'About Us' and 'Contact' Pages:</strong> Maintain consistency in your contact information. A Google Map on your page is like a virtual "You Are Here" sign.
                    </li>

                      <strong>Show Some Local Love:</strong> Create content focused on Redding's health scene. Participate in local happenings. Showcase your Redding-based team.
